## Description
StudyNetwork Analytics explores how student study relationships influence academic performance. Using Python, it analyzes 187 studentsâ€™ exam scores and study networks across three exams, leveraging Pandas for data processing, NetworkX for network analysis, and Plotly for visualization to uncover patterns like homophily and performance correlations.

---

## Features
- Generates synthetic student data (exam scores, labs, gender) for 187 students.
- Calculates homophily by lab and gender across three exam periods.
- Analyzes probability of same-lab study partnerships.
- Correlates number of study partners with final grades.
- Visualizes study network dynamics with Plotly parallel coordinates.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and generation.
- **NetworkX**: Social network analysis and homophily calculations.
- **Plotly**: Interactive parallel coordinate visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: Static plotting support.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kamaleshpantra/studynetwork-analytics.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd studynetwork-analytics`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas networkx plotly matplotlib`
4. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook StudyNetwork_Analytics.ipynb`

---

## Usage
- Run `StudyNetwork_Analytics.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Execute cells sequentially to:
  - Generate student data and study networks.
  - Compute homophily by lab and gender.
  - Analyze lab-based study relationships and performance correlations.
  - Visualize results with an interactive Plotly plot.
